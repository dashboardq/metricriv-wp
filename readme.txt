Provides overall stats and metrics for your site and also provides the ability to create a connection with MetricRiv.com.

== Description ==

The MetricRiv plugin provides a simple page that gives you a quick overview of the stats for your WordPress site and the overall stats of your WooCommerce store if you have WooCommerce installed.

This plugin allows for the creation of a connection key that can be used on [MetricRiv.com](https://www.metricriv.com) to pull in metrics and make calculations on the stats for your site and store. MetricRiv also provides additional options like the ability to pull data from specific date ranges or combine the data with other 3rd party stats.

Be careful to keep the MetricRiv keys private. Anyone with access to the keys will be able to see private and sensitive stats about your site.
